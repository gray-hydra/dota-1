# dota-1

This is a browser-based web app that I use to track my matches in the game Dota 2.
It uses a PostreSQL database to hold the data for played matches.
The program works through HTTP POST and PUT requests to send data to the database with Node.js.
The /pages directory containts all of the ejs files which function as html pages.
